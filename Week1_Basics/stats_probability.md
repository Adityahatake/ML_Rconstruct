# Statistics & Probability (Week 1)

- Mean = Sum of values / Number of values
- Median = Middle value
- Variance = Average of squared differences from Mean
- Std Deviation = Square root of Variance


## Probability
- P(A) = (# of favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes)
- Independent events: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)
- Conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

## Example (Titanic)
- Probability a passenger survived:
  P(Survived=1) = survivors / total passengers
